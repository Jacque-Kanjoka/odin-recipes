    <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
    <p>A meat pie is a pie with a filling of meat and often with other savory ingredients. They are found in cuisines worldwide.</p> 
    <p>Meat pies are usually baked, fried, or deep fried to brown them and develop the flavour through the Maillard reaction.</p>
    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    <b>Crust</b>

        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shortening or butter</li>
            <li>4 tbsp. cold water</li>
        </ul>
    
    <b>Filling</b>
    
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup chopped potato</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 tbs. margarine or butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried thyme or sage, crushed</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup chopped carrots and peas</li>
            <li>2 cups ground beef</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>
        <b>FILLING:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Sprinkle beef with 1/2 tsp salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Add 1/3 of the beef and brown aggressively all over, then remove. Repeat with remaining beef, adding more oil if needed.
                    Turn stove down to medium high. Add garlic and onion, cook 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add flour, stir through.</li>
                <li>Slowly add beef stock while stirring constantly. Once flour is dissolved, add wine, tomato paste, Worcestershire, pepper and bay leaves.
                    Return beef into pot, cover with lid, adjust heat so it’s simmering gently.</li>
                <li>Simmer 1 hr 45 minutes. Remove lid, increase heat slightly and simmer 30 – 45 minutes, stirring regularly, or until beef is fork tender and liquid reduces down to a thickish gravy, just about covering beef (see video). Do not reduce liquid too much – thickens more as it cools & in pie.
                    Remove from stove, cover and cool filling (I usually leave overnight).</li>
            </ol>
        
        
        <b>PASTRY:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F.</li>
            <li>Cut out 6 rounds from the shortcrust pastry, then drape pastry into pie tins – don’t stretch and pull pastry, causes shrinkage. (Notes 1 & 6)
                Place pies on tray. Top each pie with large sheets of parchment / baking paper and fill with pie weights (Note 7).</li>
            <li>Bake 20 minutes, remove, then use paper overhang to carefully remove pie weights.</li>
            <li>Return crusts into oven for 5 minutes or until base is light golden and dry (can skip, Note 8). Remove from oven.</li>
        </ol>

        <b>ASSEMBLE PIES:</b>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Fill pies with cooled filling, push down to fill. Should be slightly mounded.</li>
                <li>Cut rounds from partially thawed puff pastry – cut them slightly larger than the edge of the cooked pastry bases.</li>
                <li>Brush edge of pie crusts with egg, then place lid on filling, pressing edges to seal puff pastry to the shortcrust pastry.</li>
                <li>Brush lids with egg, then cut a 1cm / 0.5″ incision in the middle using a small knife.</li>
                <li>Bake 30 minutes or until deep golden and puffed.</li>
                <li>Devour hot and fresh, topped with tomato sauce or ketchup if desired!</li>

            </ol>
